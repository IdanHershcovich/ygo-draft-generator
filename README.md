# ygo-draft-generator
Project that replicates the Yu-Gi-Oh! "pre-release" experience

## What this app should do:

* ~~Get all yugioh sets in some order~~
* display all cards inside a selected set
* create "packs" of randomized cards from the set
* calculate pull rates for the packs of a set
* Generate a .ydk deck list from 5 sealed packs
